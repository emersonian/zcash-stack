# Zcash Stack Helm Chart

This chart enables the reliable deployment of Zcash infrastructure on Kubernetes.

We run this using K3s on self-hosted hardware, and also on Vultr Kubernetes Engine.

All of the "zec.rocks" lightwalletd servers are provisioned using this chart, and are load balanced using HAProxy on Fly.io. Refer to the [zecrocks repository](https://github.com/emersonian/zecrocks) for the source code to our load balancing approach.

This project is funded by [Zcash Community Grants](https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/). Progress updates are posted to a [thread on the Zcash Community Forum](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/rfp-zcash-lightwalletd-infrastructure-development-and-maintenance/47080).

## Prerequisites

1. A running Kubernetes cluster (this is currently tested on Vultr Kubernetes Engine)
2. The KUBECONFIG env variable set to your cluster's Kubernetes credentials file
3. Helm installed in your local environment

## Usage

1. Traefik is required to auto-provision LetsEncrypt SSL certificates.

    a. Edit ```install-traefik.sh``` to specify your real email address.

    b. Install Traefik on your cluster:

```
chmod +x install-traefik.sh
./install-traefik.sh
```

2. Edit an example values file from the ```./examples``` folder. Specify the domain name that you intend to host a lightwalletd instance on. View the ```values.yaml``` file to see all of the configuration options possible.

3. Add the zcash-stack Helm repository to your environment:

```
helm repo add zcash https://emersonian.github.io/zcash-stack
helm repo update
```

4. Install the chart on your cluster: (specify your own yaml file if you did not modify an example in-place)

```
helm install zcash zcash/zcash-stack -f examples/zebra-mainnet.yaml
```

### Upgrading

We highly recommend installing the "helm-diff" plugin.

Pull the latest release of the zcash-stack Helm chart:
```
helm repo update
```

Confirm the name of your node's Helm deployment:
```
KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config-eu1 helm list
```

Verify changes before you upgrade: (in this example, the chart was installed as "zec-eu1")
```
KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config-eu1 helm diff upgrade zec-eu1 zcash/zcash-stack -f ./values-eu1.yaml
```

Then apply the upgrade:
```
KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config-eu1 helm upgrade zec-eu1 zcash/zcash-stack -f ./values-eu1.yaml
```

### Kubernetes Cheat Sheet

If you're new to Kubernetes, here is a list of commands that you might find useful for operating this chart:

```
# See what is running in your cluster's default namespace
kubectl get all

# Watch logs
kubectl logs -f statefulset/lightwalletd
kubectl logs -f statefulset/zebra
kubectl logs -f statefulset/zcashd

# Open a shell in a running container
kubectl exec statefulset/zebra -ti -- bash

# Restart a part of the stack
kubectl rollout restart statefulset/lightwalletd
kubectl rollout restart statefulset/zebra
kubectl rollout restart statefulset/zcashd

# View the public IPs provisioned by Traefik
kubectl get service -n traefik
```

## Works in progress

- Updated documentation to launch on AWS, GCP, and self-hosted (k3s)
- Support for hosting a block explorer
- Contribute to the P2P network by allowing inbound connections via a Kubernetes Service, only possible on Zcashd at the moment.
